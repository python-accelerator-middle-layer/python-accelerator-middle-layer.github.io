The governance of the collaboration is described in the [governance document](https://github.com/python-accelerator-middle-layer/governance/blob/main/governance_document/pyAML_governance_v1.0.0_20250411.pdf).

The collaboration works according to the following guiding principles:

<ol style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1;">
  <li>
    <p><strong>We have collaboration as a core-value.</strong></p>
    <p>We aim to develop a diverse community of people from accelerator laboratories around the world cultivating an environment of inclusivity, cooperation, and sharing.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>We aim for user-centered design.</strong></p>
    <p>We will enable users of all levels to use the software and participate in the project by keeping barriers low.</p>
    <p>The software should follow the principles and practices of modern software engineering, be easy to install on the systems used by the community, easy to configure and easy to start to use.</p>
    <p>We should have a modular architecture which allows users to configure, use and develop algorithms and tools.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>We value our data.</strong></p>
    <p>Configuration data should be separated from source code, easily updated and follow a common standard which can be extended if required.</p>
    <p>We should have a standard for how to save measurement and analysis data together with appropriate metadata.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
